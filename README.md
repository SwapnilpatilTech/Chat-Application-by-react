# Chat-Application-by-react

This repository now includes a minimal React + Vite scaffold under `src/`.

Getting started (Windows, cmd.exe):

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Start development server:

```
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```
npm run build
```

Files added:
- `package.json` - scripts and dependencies for Vite + React
- `index.html` - app entry
- `src/main.jsx`, `src/App.jsx`, `src/index.css` - minimal React app

If you prefer Create React App, Next.js, or a TypeScript setup instead, tell me which and I will re-scaffold accordingly.
